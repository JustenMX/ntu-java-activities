### Brief

1. Create two classes called Main.java and Pet.java and make sure that they belong to the same package.
2. The Pet class has the following attributes:
   - name (String)
   - breed (String)
   - gender (String)
   - age (Integer)
   - isVaccinated (Boolean)
3. The Pet class has the following methods:
   - call(String sound) - prints the sound 3 times
   - eat(String food) - prints "'name' loves eating 'food'"
   - sleep() - prints "'name' is currently sleeping"
4. The Pet class should have empty and parameterized constructors.
5. The Pet class should have getters and setters.
6. In Main.java, create 2 objects, a cat and a dog.
7. Use the methods for both the dog and cat with the necessary arguments.
