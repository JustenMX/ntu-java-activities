 * ### 👨‍💻 Activity 1 - Calculate Bonus

Create another overloaded method for `bonusCalc` that takes in the salary as well as an `enum` `Position` with the following values: `STAFF`, `MANAGER`, `CEO`.
The bonuses should be calculated as follows:

- Staff: 10% of salary
- Manager: 20% of salary
- CEO: 300% of salary

 * ### 👨‍💻 Activity 2 - Calculate Bonus for Variable Wage Worker

Now we have a variable wage worker, and we store his salary in an array. We want to calculate his bonus based on his monthly average salary. The worker should only get a bonus if he has worked for at least 6 months.
Create an overloaded method that takes in an array of salaries and calculates the bonus based on the average salary.
