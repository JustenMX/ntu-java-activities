## Introduction

This repository serves as a showcase of my journey through the Java programming exercises and activities in the NTU Software Engineering course. It includes solutions to various programming challenges and concepts taught during the course.

## Getting Started

To run the Java programs, you will need to have Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your computer. You can download the latest JDK version from [Oracle's website](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html).

Once you have JDK installed, you can clone this repository using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/ntu-java-activities.git

```

Each activity is stored in its respective folder, and you can navigate to each activity to find the Java files and README with specific instructions.
